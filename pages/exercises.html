                            Meditation can give you a sense of calm, peace and

                            well-being and your overall health. You can also use
                            it to relax and cope with stress by refocusing your
                            attention on something calming. Meditation can help
                            you learn to stay centered and keep inner peace.

                            Now, a new study published in the scientific journal
                            NeuroImage sheds fresh light on how walking is so
                            effective at improving your cognitive function and

                            Talking to people helps us vent out our emotions so
                            let's talk because talking is healing. Share your

                            When you start to feel anxious, sit in a quiet and
                            comfortable place. Think of your ideal place to
                            relax. While it can be any place in the world, real
                            or imaginary, it should be an image that you find
                            very calming, happy, peaceful, and safe. Make sure
                            it`s easy enough to think about so you can return to
                            it in your mind when you feel anxious in the future.
                            Think of all the small details you`d find if you
                            were there. Think about how the place would smell,
                            feel, and sound. Envision yourself in that place,
                            enjoying it comfortably.

                            When you feel anxious, you might notice strain or
                            tension in your muscles. This muscle stress can make
                            your anxiety more difficult to manage in the moment
                            you`re experiencing it. By relieving the stress in
                            your muscles, you can usually reduce your anxiety
                            levels.
